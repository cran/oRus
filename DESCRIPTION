Description: A first implementation of automated parsing of user stories, when used 
  to defined functional requirements for operational research mathematical 
  models. It allows reading user stories, splitting them on the who-what-why template,
  and classifying them according to the parts of the mathematical model that 
  they represent. Also provides semantic grouping of stories, 
  for project management purposes.
