The **oRus** package implements a semi-automated process to pre-analyse and organise
user stories created to represent and document the functional requirements of
mathematical models in Operational Research.

Employing user stories for this purpose was proposed as part of the concept of 
\"Agile Operational Research\" [1], and later evaluated on its own [2].
